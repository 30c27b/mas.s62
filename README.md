Bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies have gained attention over
the years as the systems continue to evolve.  This course looks at the
design of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and how they function in
practice, focusing on cryptography, game theory, and network
architecture.  Future developments in smart contracts and privacy will
be covered as well.  Programming assignments in the course will give
practical experience interacting with these currencies, so some
programming experience is required.
